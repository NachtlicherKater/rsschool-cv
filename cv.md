## About me:

  Aspiring front-end developer currently learning web technologies with a focus on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.<br>
I started my journey with the EPAM Campus program (Beginner) and gradually moved on to the Responsive Web Design course on freeCodeCamp.<br>

  I am passionate about building user-friendly, responsive interfaces and constantly improving my technical skills by reading JavaScript books and practicing coding tasks.<br>
I’m self-motivated, detail-oriented, and eager to grow as a developer.

## Code Example:

```
function evenOrOdd(number) {
  return number % 2 === 0 ? "Even" : "Odd";
}
```
